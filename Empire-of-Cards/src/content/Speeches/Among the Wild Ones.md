**Among the Wild Ones: Lessons from the Highlands Cassowaries**

**Speech Draft:**

"Good \[morning/afternoon\], fellow learners and explorers.

I come to you today with stories not from cities or farms but from the deep highlands of Papua New Guinea—where, even now, the cassowaries live as they did before fire illuminated their world. These cassowaries are wild, brilliant in their simplicity, and rich in their connections to the land and each other.

I spent five years among them—watching, listening, learning. And in the quiet hours between sunrise and dusk, I found not savagery or chaos but a structure so familiar, so deeply rooted, that it seemed to echo our very beginnings.

#### **The Family of Four**

Even in these remote, untouched forests, the pattern of four remains. It’s not always precise, but the roles are unmistakable:

1. **The Farmer**: No, they didn’t cultivate insects like we do—but there was always one who stayed close to their favored foraging sites. They would return daily to the richest fruit trees, carefully watching the cycles of ripening, almost as though they understood _when_ and _what_ to harvest.
2. **The Hunter**: This was the bold one—the cassowary that ventured out further, bringing back small prizes. Sometimes it was fallen eggs or a scurrying lizard. They were the protectors and resource seekers.
3. **The Child Rearer**: This one was constant—a watchful guardian who stood near the young, not just to protect them, but to nudge them toward lessons—how to dig for roots, how to balance caution with curiosity.
4. **The Roamer—the Flexible One**: This role fascinated me most. A female cassowary, often the eldest, moved between the roles. She visited nearby clusters of cassowaries—not to intrude, but to observe and sometimes share her knowledge. She’d be seen with a hunting group one day, guiding them toward safer areas, then near the young the next, leading them to unexplored foraging grounds.

#### **Their Lives Without Fire**

They lived in dark forest groves and highland mist, dependent not on the warmth of flames but on the warmth of _each other_. They huddled together in the cold, relying on their dense plumage and each other's company during the wet seasons. And while they had no fire for cooking, they had something else: **collaboration**.

The "Farmer" of the group would shift their foraging routes slowly, ensuring there was always food close to where the others rested. When food was scarce, the "Hunter" would share what they found without hesitation—perhaps because the bonds between them felt more like a necessity than a choice.

#### **Friendship in the Forest**

I still remember the first time they accepted me—not as one of them, but as something familiar. It began with the Roamer. She was curious about me and my strange ways. She'd tilt her head, one sharp yellow eye fixed on my every move, as though she were memorizing my patterns. I watched her interact with her family—soft guttural sounds, subtle shifts of posture. Slowly, I began to understand their 'words'—a low hum for gathering, a shrill pulse for danger, a short clicking sound when the young wandered too far.

One morning, she approached me with no fear. I sat still, heart pounding, as she stretched out her head and lightly pecked the ground near my feet. A gesture of _trust._ From that day on, they allowed me closer. I saw the tender ways the young learned by doing—digging, climbing over roots—and how they carried lessons from one clearing to the next, like seeds in their talons.

#### **The Cassowary Courtship Tradition**

And then came the season of dispersal—the time when the young grew restless and began venturing further. The Roamer guided them as they practiced independence. I watched as one juvenile, nearly grown, followed her on a visit to another group. She didn’t stay, though—it was clear her role was to bring the young to a place where they could meet others their age, learn new paths, and, eventually, form their own families.

This wasn’t just courtship. It was knowledge-sharing—a way of expanding bonds beyond a single group. When they left their birth groves, they took with them not just survival skills but memories of how to foster connection.

#### **Why This Matters**

We often speak of fire as the spark that changed us, the moment when we became who we are today. But the cassowaries in the highlands live without fire, and yet they are not lesser. They remind us that before flames, there was something older—something that lies at the core of all our success: _trust and cooperation_.

In these small families of four—hunters, farmers, child rearers, and roamers—we see echoes of our present society. The Roamer, like the female Connectors in our homes, ensures that each generation doesn’t just inherit the same ideas but grows richer with new knowledge and perspectives. The hunters and farmers maintain stability, and the child rearers pass on the culture that makes us who we are.

When we speak of the wild cassowaries, let us not speak of savagery. Let us speak of _potential_. They are us, just as we were them once. And in their quiet, humble ways, they remind us of our roots: the strength of connection, the resilience of balance, and the legacy of those who share knowledge not for their own gain but for the future."

"The wild cassowaries taught me that knowledge is a journey—and sometimes, the strongest leaders are the ones who know how to walk beside others."

### **Key Concepts in This Speech:**

- **Pre-Fire Societies**: Cassowaries without fire still developed roles and familial bonds, relying on each other to navigate harsh environments.
- **The Roamer as a Connector**: Female cassowaries served as vital knowledge-sharers and "ambassadors" between groups.
- **Dispersal and Courtship**: Young cassowaries dispersed to form their own groups, aided by their Roamer mentors.
- **Empathy and Observation**: The speaker emphasizes that cooperation existed before intelligence "as we know it," showing that bonds of trust form the foundation for societal growth.
