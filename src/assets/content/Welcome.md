# Welcome to Sahul's Legacy

Greetings, seekers of tales and wanderers of timelines! I am Estafyn, your avian guide, a cassowary with feathers sharp as thought and a penchant for world-building through the wonders of parallel discoveries and modern contraptions. By some improbable twist of fate (or perhaps a glitch in the narrative), I share your world’s tools—keyboards, displays, and microphones alike—so that I may craft this place for your enjoyment.

This is the **Empire of Cards** adventure hub! Here, we collect the whispers of bygone eras, the echoes of untold stories, and the foundations of Sahul’s most peculiar legacy.

---

## **Getting Started:**

- Navigate the Table of Contents like an explorer tracing ancient maps.
- Click through the chapters to immerse yourself in the ever-growing chronicles.
- Marvel at the resilience of Sahul’s heroes and scholars who dared to rise above the fronds.

---

## **Lore Highlights:**

- **Cassowary Societies:** These are no simple flocks! Here lie worlds of intellect, invention, and fierce independence where knowledge flows as freely as the river tides.
- **The Age of Queens:** Before kingdoms and empires, there were queens whose stories shaped destiny and dissolved into legend. Their reigns stretched across lands as feathers across the horizon.
- **The Great Inferno:** A catastrophe of fire and ash that scarred the jungles and molded heroes from ruin. This event became the turning point for the civilizations of Sahul, marking the end of innocence and the dawn of ambition.

## **Instructions:**

- To witness the stories, choose a scroll (or rather, a clickable file) from the sidebar.
- If the tales falter or the interface stumbles, remember: every journey may require a brief return to the beginning. Refresh your mind (and page) as needed.

The stories you encounter are but feathers in the grand plumage of Sahul’s evolving legacy. I invite you to journey deep into these chronicles, for this world is but a work in progress—its halls adorned with the scaffolds of imagination.

Together, we shall weave the Empire of Cards, a bastion of dreams, resilience, and wonder.

Let’s begin the journey!
