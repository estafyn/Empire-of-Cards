# **Style Guide**

This guide provides a comprehensive framework for writing stories set in a parallel Sahul, where intelligent, tool-using cassowaries have evolved into the dominant species. It balances realism with creative speculation, emphasizing unique storytelling while reflecting real-world parallels.

---

## **I. Core Principles**

1. **Biological Realism and Speculation:**  
   Ground all developments in the known biology of cassowaries and Australian fauna while creatively speculating about their evolution, intelligence, and societal structures. Cassowary cognition should be distinctively avian, not human-like.

2. **Cassowary-Centric Perspective:**  
   Stories should prioritize cassowary characters. Explore their inner lives, motivations, and social interactions. Humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans exist but are subservient and lack the complexity of cassowary society.

3. **Worldbuilding as a Character:**  
   The environment of Sahul—its flora, fauna, and ecological challenges—should play a key role in shaping narratives and character arcs.

4. **Historical Parallels and Evolutionary Themes:**  
   Draw inspiration from historical empires and economic systems like the East India Company and Roman Empire to frame the rise of cassowary civilizations.

## **II. Worldbuilding Elements**

### **1. Cassowaries**

- **Evolution:** Descended from clawed, flightless ancestors with arboreal tendencies. Capable of tool use, with some mastering fire for cooking, defense, and ecosystem control.
- **Physical Traits:** Sturdy legs, strong claws (evolved from vestigial wings), and adaptable necks. Plumage is regionally adapted but always retains the iconic blue and red hues. The casque (head crest) shows age and enhances sound reception.
- **Cognition:** Highly intelligent, with advanced problem-solving abilities, but their thought processes and communication styles remain avian.
- **Social Structures:**
  - Polycule family units are common, typically consisting of one female and multiple males.
  - Leadership roles can vary by culture, with some groups emphasizing skill and others valuing heritage.
- **Diet:** Omnivorous—includes insects, fruits, and managed prey species like kangaroos. Some societies domesticate emus and bush turkeys for food.

### **2. Domesticated Species**

- **Ravens:**
  - **Role:** Record-keepers and scribes, responsible for documenting events and legal transactions.
  - **Traits:** High intelligence and a knack for pattern recognition. They can inscribe symbols but rarely express personal opinions.
- **Cockatoos:**
  - **Role:** Messengers, akin to mobile voice notes.
  - **Traits:** Mimicry, strong memory, and independent personalities. They are essential for diplomacy and emergency alerts.
- **Eagles:**
  - **Role:** Hunting companions and scouts.
  - **Traits:** Sharp eyesight, loyalty to handlers, and deadly precision. Used for hunting, reconnaissance, and even defense.
- **Diprotodons:**
  - **Role:** Megafauna used for transportation.
  - **Traits:** Intelligent and emotionally perceptive, requiring consistent care. They power the mechanical infrastructure, such as rail systems and ships.

### **3. Environment**

- **Setting:** Pre-human Greater Australia (Sahul), characterized by vast rainforests, savannas, and wetlands.
- **Key Locations:** Bustling trade hubs, isolated mining camps, and riverine ports.
- **Environmental Change:** Sea-level fluctuations and climate shifts influence migration, settlement, and resource availability.

## **III. Storytelling Guidelines**

### **Genre:**

Speculative historical fiction with a focus on realism and scientific curiosity.

### **Key Themes:**

- **Evolution and Adaptation:** How do cassowaries respond to environmental pressures?
- **Social Complexity:** Explore power dynamics within and between cassowary clans.
- **Nature of Intelligence:** What does sapience mean in an avian context?
- **Technology and Culture:** How do fire mastery and domestication shape cassowary societies?
- **Freedom vs. Servitude:** Examine systems of debt and labor exploitation.
- **Identity and Legacy:** How do cassowaries define themselves within a rapidly expanding empire?
- **Emotional Communication:** Highlight avian communication methods, from vocalizations to body language.

## **IV. Specific Considerations for Cassowary Characters**

### **1. Inner Lives:**

Focus on their thoughts and emotional struggles, showing their growing self-awareness and agency.

### **2. Communication:**

Cassowaries communicate through a blend of vocalizations, gestures, and subtle feather movements. Cockatoos and ravens amplify their messages but are not independent decision-makers.

### **3. Motivations:**

What drives each cassowary? Are they loyal to the empire, or do they seek personal freedom? How do they reconcile individual desires with societal roles?

### **4. Conflict:**

Explore internal conflicts, external threats, and shifting alliances within their society.

---

## **V. Economic Systems**

### **1. Historical Parallels:**

Draw from real-world examples like the East India Company, Roman slavery, and convict labor systems.

### **2. Corporate Power:**

Highlight the Werribee Traders Association’s (WTA) dominance over political and economic life.

### **3. Class Exploitation:**

Contrast the lives of free citizens, partially owned laborers, and enslaved individuals to examine social inequality.

### **4. Commodification of Labor:**

Show how beings (human and otherwise) are treated as commodities, reflecting historical injustices.

## **VI. Don’ts**

1. **No Magic/Supernatural:** Keep events grounded in biological and technological plausibility.
2. **Avoid Monolithic Cultures:** Cassowary societies should be diverse, with different traditions and technologies.
3. **No Other Sentient Species:** Only cassowaries and humans display complex societies, with humans remaining subservient.

---

## **VII. Key Design Principles**

1. **Authenticity:** Ensure that the world feels believable. Research where necessary.
2. **Flexibility:** The guide is a foundation, not a rigid set of rules—adapt it as needed.
3. **Scientific Basis:** Use evolutionary biology, anthropology, and economic theory to inform world-building decisions.
