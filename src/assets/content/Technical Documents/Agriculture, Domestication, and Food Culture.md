# Technical Document: Agriculture, Domestication, and Food Culture in Cassowary Civilization

This document provides an overview of the domesticated species, farming methods, and food culture of the cassowary civilization in Sahul (Greater Australia). It details how species have changed through domestication, the diversity of farming practices across regions, and the culinary practices that sustain both rural and urban cassowary populations.

## **1\. Domesticated Plant Species**

The cassowaries' long-term presence in Sahul allowed them to domesticate and refine native plants. Over millennia, selective cultivation led to larger yields, better storage, and easier harvesting.

### **Domesticated Plants and Their Changes**

| Species            | Modern State                                                   | Domesticated Changes                                                                                                          |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kangaroo Grass** | Native grass producing small seeds.                            | Selected for larger seeds, faster growth, and easier harvesting. Cultivated as the primary grain for flatbreads and porridge. |
| **Yam Daisy**      | Wild tubers with low yields.                                   | Larger, more nutritious tubers. Rotational planting improves soil health and yields.                                          |
| **Quandong**       | Wild fruit with tough, fibrous flesh.                          | Sweeter, larger fruits with thinner skin, making them easier to eat and store.                                                |
| **Macadamia Nuts** | Small nuts with hard shells.                                   | Larger nuts with thinner shells, bred for higher oil and calorie content.                                                     |
| **Wild Rice**      | Wetland-adapted rice with small seeds.                         | Larger seeds and higher yields from managed wetland farming.                                                                  |
| **Wattleseed**     | Small seeds from acacia trees, requiring extensive processing. | Easier-to-harvest pods and higher seed density. Used for flour and flavoring.                                                 |
| **Taro**           | Native wetland tuber found in parts of Papua New Guinea.       | Larger tubers with reduced toxicity, cultivated in wetland zones.                                                             |
| **Native Mint**    | Aromatic herb found in forests.                                | Grown near settlements for flavoring and medicinal uses.                                                                      |

## **2\. Domesticated Animal and Insect Species**

Cassowaries domesticated animals and insects differently than humans, focusing on semi-wild management and coexisting with their ecosystems.

### **Domesticated Animals**

| Species       | Modern State                                   | Domesticated Changes                                                                               |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wallabies** | Wild grazers dependent on native grasslands.   | Encouraged to graze in fire-cleared areas. Semi-wild herds are culled for meat.                    |
| **Eels**      | Migratory fish species in rivers and wetlands. | Managed in artificial channels and traps, with selective breeding for size and reproductive rates. |

### **Domesticated Insects**

| Species             | Modern State                                                     | Domesticated Changes                                                                                                       |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Witchetty Grubs** | Wild larvae found in acacia roots.                               | Larger larvae with higher fat content, grown in modular "root systems" for easier harvesting.                              |
| **Honey Pot Ants**  | Nectar-storing ants in arid regions.                             | Increased nectar production and tolerance for artificial nesting systems near settlements.                                 |
| **Termites**        | Decomposers found in woodlands and grasslands.                   | Larger colonies with termites producing higher protein yields. Managed in wood mounds or artificial habitats.              |
| **Green Tree Ants** | Arboreal ants with protein-rich larvae and sour-flavored bodies. | Improved larval yield and less aggressive behavior. Colonies integrated into forest gardens for dual pest control/harvest. |

## **3\. Farming Methods by Region**

### **Grasslands and Fire-Cleared Farms (Mainland Australia)**

- **Primary Crops**: Kangaroo grass, yam daisies, wattleseed.
- **Methods**:
  - Rotational controlled burns clear competing vegetation and fertilize soil.
  - Semi-wild wallabies graze in cleared areas, providing meat.

### **Forest Gardens (Eastern Australia and PNG)**

- **Primary Crops**: Quandongs, macadamias, green tree ants, witchetty grubs.
- **Methods**:
  - Multilayered agroforestry integrates food trees and host plants for insects.
  - Selective harvesting ensures ecological balance.

### **Wetland Farms (Werribee and Other Riverine Areas)**

- **Primary Crops**: Taro, wild rice, water chestnuts; eels and fish.
- **Methods**:
  - Seasonal flooding and constructed channels manage water levels for crops and aquaculture.
  - Rotational use of wetland edges maintains fertility.

---

## **4\. Farming in the Werribee Region**

The Werribee region is especially productive due to its fertile volcanic soils, reliable seasonal rains, and diverse ecosystems.

### **Key Crops and Practices**

- **Grasslands**: Kangaroo grass and yam daisies thrive in fire-cleared areas.
- **Wetlands**: Eels and wild rice are farmed along seasonal flood zones.
- **Forest Gardens**: Quandongs and macadamias grow in pockets of woodland.

### **Farm Layout**

- Farms are integrated with the natural landscape, with clear divisions for crops, wetlands, and managed forests.
- Seasonal rotations and fire use optimize productivity and sustainability.
