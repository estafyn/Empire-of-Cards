# **Werribee Traders Association (WTA)**

---

## **Scope:**

This document outlines the history, structure, and economic model of the Werribee Traders Association (WTA), charting its rise from a regional company to a continent-spanning empire controlling Sahul (Greater Australia). Over 1,420 years, the WTA evolved from a merchant cooperative into the sole governing entity of an empire akin to Rome’s rule over Europe.

## **1. Founding and Historical Expansion**

- **Origins (Year 0 of the WTA Calendar):**  
  Formed to govern trade routes along the Werribee River, securing the gold-rich lands of the central highlands.

- **Initial Role:**  
  Managed trade regulations, defense against rival clans, and infrastructure development in the Werribee region.

- **Major Turning Points:**
  - **Year 200:** Annexed neighboring river towns, forming an interconnected trade network.
  - **Year 600:** Consolidated control over key goldfields, granting near-total economic influence over Sahul’s interior.
  - **Year 1,000:** Integrated Diprotodon-powered transport routes across Sahul, connecting distant provinces with efficiency.
  - **Year 1,200:** Established maritime dominance with cable-driven ships, extending control to New Guinea and the Sunda islands.

By Year 1,420, the WTA governed the entire supercontinent, defining politics, law, and economy much like how Rome ruled over Europe during its height.

## **2. Organizational Structure**

- **Council of Traders:**  
  Governs the empire, with representatives from major cities and goldfield regions.

- **Provincial Overseers:**  
  Appointed governors who manage conquered territories and ensure tribute reaches Werribee.

- **Military Wing:**  
  Initially a defensive force, the WTA’s armies grew into a professional legion-like force, used to enforce trade laws and quell rebellions.

## **3. Economic and Legal Dominance**

- **Monetary Policy:**  
  Gold became the standard currency, and trade was regulated through WTA-issued "labor shares."

- **Tribute System:**  
  Conquered regions were required to send raw materials and exotic goods to Werribee.

- **Legal Authority:**  
  The WTA instituted laws governing contracts, property rights, and debt, making it both a judiciary and executive power.

## **4. Cultural Integration and Expansion**

- **Cultural Assimilation:**  
  Provincial populations were absorbed into the empire through education in WTA customs, including the use of cockatoo messengers and Diprotodon transport.

- **Religious Influence:**  
  Temples to wealth and prosperity—funded by merchant elites—became cultural hubs in conquered territories.

## **5. Declaring "One Sahul"**

By claiming exclusive control of resources, from gold veins to river networks, the WTA proclaimed itself the rightful unifier of the supercontinent. It maintained this narrative through economic incentives and military might, much like Rome’s Pax Romana.
