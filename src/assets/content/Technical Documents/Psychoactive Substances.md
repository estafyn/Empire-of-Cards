# Psychoactive Substances in the Age of Queens

This document outlines the psychoactive substances used by cassowary societies during the Age of Queens and later periods. Each substance is based on realistic biological, ecological, and environmental factors shaped by the unique ecosystems of Sahul (Greater Australia and Tasmania). The substances are classified by preparation method, effects, and their role in cassowary society.

## 1. Environmental Context for Psychoactive Evolution:

The prehistoric ecosystems of Sahul shaped the flora and fauna in unique ways:

- **Nutrient-Poor Soils:** Australian soils were low in key nutrients, causing plants to evolve chemical defenses like alkaloids to deter herbivores. Some of these alkaloids had psychoactive effects.
- **Fire-Adapted Vegetation:** Regular fires selected for plants that were both fire-resistant and capable of producing volatile oils that could be psychoactive when heated or burned.
- **Isolated Evolution:** Tasmania’s geographic isolation allowed unique plants and amphibians to evolve distinct chemical compounds.
- **Co-Evolution with Animals:** Some plants evolved symbiotic relationships with animals, creating more potent or specialized chemical interactions.

## 2. Primary Psychoactive Substances:

### 2.1. Emberleaf (Smoked Substance)

- **Plant Origin:** A species of fire-adapted shrub native to the volcanic plains of Tasmania and parts of Gippsland.
- **Scientific Basis:** Emberleaf contains beta-carbolines, alkaloids similar to those found in harmala plants, which enhance serotonin signaling. When burned, the compounds create a smoke that crosses the blood-brain barrier rapidly, inducing hallucinogenic and emotional effects.

#### Preparation:

- Dried leaves are bundled into "plume rolls" and burned in ceremonial braziers or smoked directly.

#### Effects:

- **Low Dosage:** Mild euphoria and a sense of warmth. Enhanced perception of movement and sound, making ceremonial dances feel synchronized and profound.
- **High Dosage:** Vivid visual hallucinations of “feathered” light patterns and flowing rivers. Users describe feeling like they are “floating on an ember tide.”
- **After-Effects:** Mild lethargy, introspection, and increased emotional vulnerability.

#### Cultural Role:

- Used during initiation rites and funerary rituals to ease grief and create a communal sense of connection.
- Warriors in Yarrawarra’s armies used small doses before amphibious raids to heighten their courage and focus.

#### Human Analogue:

- Cannabis (smoked), combined with DMT-like visions due to the beta-carboline enhancement.

### 2.2. Ashmead (Psychoactive Drink)

- **Plant Origin:** Derived from the Flameberry vine, a fruit-bearing plant found in Tasmanian rainforests. The vine produces small, orange berries that contain psychoactive phenethylamines similar to mescaline and small amounts of serotonin analogues.

#### Preparation:

- The berries are fermented with honey and rainwater for several weeks, creating a thick, spicy drink known as “Ashmead.”

#### Effects:

- **Low Dosage:** Feelings of tranquility and empathy, often described as "the hearth within."
- **High Dosage:** A warming, almost dissociative euphoria that slows physical perception but increases emotional depth. Cassowaries often describe feeling “detached but aware” of their surroundings.
- **Overuse:** Can cause lethargy, confusion, and vivid emotional flashbacks.

#### Cultural Role:

- Served at peace councils and negotiation feasts to reduce hostility and foster honest dialogue.
- Some priestesses used Ashmead for meditation and spiritual introspection during periods of mourning or political crisis.

#### Human Analogue:

- Ayahuasca (with a calming effect), mescaline, and mild dissociatives.

## 3. Rare Psychoactive Substances:

### 3.1. Dreamscale (Amphibian Secretion)

- **Source:** The Golden Reed Frog, a brightly colored amphibian native to Gippsland’s marshlands. The frog produces a secretion that contains psychoactive indoleamines similar to bufotenin (found in some toads) and DMT.

#### Preparation:

- The secretion is collected by gently “milking” the frogs and is then dried into a resin or dissolved in water.

#### Effects:

- Intense, short-lived hallucinations of kaleidoscopic patterns and auditory distortions. Users often describe hearing ancestral voices calling their names.
- Creates a strong sense of detachment from the physical body, followed by a euphoric “return.”
- Can cause extreme anxiety if the user is in an unfamiliar or chaotic setting.

#### Cultural Role:

- Used by Yarrawarra oracles during high-stakes rituals where visions of ancestors were sought for guidance.
- Considered dangerous and used sparingly due to its intense dissociative effects.

#### Human Analogue:

- 5-MeO-DMT (toad venom), bufotenin.

### 3.2. Whisperroot (Herbaceous Hallucinogen)

- **Plant Origin:** A forest-dwelling fern found in Tasmania’s temperate rainforests. The root contains psilocybin-like tryptamines that cause vivid sensory hallucinations, particularly auditory distortions.

#### Preparation:

- The fibrous root is dried, ground, and steeped in boiling water to create a bitter tea.

#### Effects:

- Hallucinations of whispers, chants, and distant calls that users interpret as ancestral voices.
- Time distortion, with moments feeling prolonged or suspended.
- High doses can cause paranoia and emotional dissociation.

#### Cultural Role:

- Used by priestesses and prophets to interpret political or military omens.
- Whisperroot was sometimes used by exiled priestesses who sought solitary spiritual journeys.

#### Human Analogue:

- Psilocybin mushrooms (auditory and time-related effects).

### 3.3. Ironbark Extract (Dissociative Resin)

- **Plant Origin:** A rare sap found in the Ironbark Eucalyptus tree, enriched by its proximity to mineral-rich soils. The sap contains chemical compounds similar to ketamine analogues that induce dissociation and analgesia.

#### Preparation:

- Collected as hardened resin and boiled down into a syrup, then mixed into hot water or consumed directly.

#### Effects:

- Dissociative detachment from the body, accompanied by a profound sense of calm and numbness.
- Slowed motor control and “floating” sensations, but increased pain tolerance.
- Can cause emotional numbness and depressive after-effects with repeated use.

#### Cultural Role:

- Used by injured warriors as a painkiller during recovery.
- Some queens used it strategically in political settings to suppress fear during high-stakes negotiations.

#### Human Analogue:

- Ketamine (dissociative anaesthetic).

## 4. Ecological and Social Impacts:

- The destruction of Tasmanian trade routes during the Great Inferno led to a decline in psychoactive herb availability, contributing to the collapse of ceremonial traditions.
- The rare nature of substances like Dreamscale and Ironbark Extract meant they were often associated with elites, leading to tensions with commoners who sought access to these “gifts of the ancestors.”

## Conclusion:

Psychoactive substances in the Age of Queens were shaped by the unique ecosystems of Sahul and Tasmania. While some substances enhanced religious and cultural rituals, others became tools of war and political control. The legacy of these substances persisted through the fractured Age of the Feather Realms, influencing both the rise of merchant societies and the spiritual practices of future generations.
