# Timeline

## **1\. Ratite Ancestors Arrive in Sahul**

**Human Time:** \~30 million years ago  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~30 million years ago

**Environment:**

- Australia (Sahul) is lush and tropical, dominated by vast rainforests stretching from modern-day **Cape York Peninsula** in the north down through **Queensland's coast**.
- Antarctica, still partially forested, allows avian species to migrate as it drifts southward.
- Papua New Guinea is connected to northern Australia by land bridges, forming a massive continental landmass.

**Technologies:**

- None. This period marks biological adaptation rather than technological advancement.

**Cultures:**

- None. These ratites are solitary, territorial, and have no social structure.

**Biological Changes:**

- The ancestors of cassowaries adapt to Sahul’s environment, evolving long legs for running and small wings for balance.
- Diet shifts toward omnivory, with early cassowaries supplementing fruit with insects.

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- No divergence yet. Both timelines follow the same evolutionary path as ratites become dominant megafaunal birds in Sahul.

### **2\. Arboreal Cassowary Era**

**Human Time:** \~15 million years ago  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~15 million years ago

**Environment:**

- Rainforests dominate northern Australia (modern **Daintree Rainforest** region) and extend into **Arnhem Land** and **Papua New Guinea**.
- Coastal areas are dense with mangroves, while the southern regions (modern **Victoria** and **Tasmania**) are temperate rainforests.

**Technologies:**

- None. Proto-cassowaries rely solely on biological adaptations for foraging and survival.

**Cultures:**

- Rudimentary vocalizations emerge as warning calls for territory defense. Proto-cassowaries are solitary, territorial, and do not cooperate socially.

**Biological Changes:**

- Small claws develop at the end of their wing stubs to assist with climbing.
- Diet shifts to include more insects (beetles, ants) and high-canopy fruit.

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- In the cassowary world, cassowaries become semi-arboreal foragers with small social interactions. In the human timeline, mammals (especially early primates) continue as ground-based species adapting to savannas.

### **3\. The Age of Insect Farming**

**Human Time:** \~2 million years ago  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~2 million years ago

**Environment:**

- Northern Australia (**Cape York**, **Kakadu**, and **Arnhem Land**) remains densely forested and humid.
- Central Australia is semi-arid but retains patches of wetland. Papua New Guinea’s mountain regions are humid and fertile.
- Large fruiting trees and decaying plant matter support rich insect populations.

**Technologies:**

- Basic nest-building using leaves, bark, and decaying fruit to attract witchetty grubs, ants, and beetles.
- Cassowaries learn to **cultivate specific decaying materials** to optimize insect farming.

**Cultures:**

- The first social units form around insect farms—groups of four specializing in different roles: Farmer, Hunter, Child Rearer, and Connector.
- Groups remain small and territorial but begin cooperating within family units.

**Biological Changes:**

- Improved cognitive abilities due to a high-protein insect diet.
- Social instincts begin to evolve, favoring cooperation within small groups.

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- Humans remain ground-based hunters and foragers in Africa. Cassowaries develop early cooperative farming behaviors.

### **4\. The Age of Fire**

**Human Time:** \~1 million years ago  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~1 million years ago

**Environment:**

- Northern Australia (Cape York and **Kakadu** regions) remains forested but experiences seasonal dry spells.
- Central Australia transitions into arid savanna, with patches of open grasslands interspersed with dry forests.

**Technologies:**

- Fire management begins—cassowaries learn to maintain small fires from natural wildfires.
- Hearth incubation increases survival rates, leading to longer hatching times and larger brains.

**Cultures:**

- Hearths become central to nests, symbolizing the birth of permanent "homes."
- Nest groups develop **rituals** around fire maintenance and feeding the hearth.

**Biological Changes:**

- Shorter necks evolve to balance larger heads.
- Stronger pelvic muscles and longer legs improve upright posture, enabling cassowaries to tend their fires.

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- Humans in Africa begin using simple tools and may have interacted with fire occasionally, but cassowaries establish it as a core part of their reproductive success.

### **5\. The Age of Expansion**

**Human Time:** \~270,000 years ago  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~Year \-200,000

**Environment:**

- Rainforests retreat to northern Australia and coastal regions. The interior becomes open savanna and grasslands, dotted with freshwater lakes and billabongs.
- Papua New Guinea remains forested but develops open highlands ideal for cassowary settlements.

**Technologies:**

- Stone tools for cracking tough seeds, sharpening sticks, and processing prey.
- Early versions of throwing spears and digging tools for expanding insect farms.

**Cultures:**

- Population booms lead to larger nesting clusters, forming early "villages."
- Social dynamics shift as female Connectors travel between groups, carrying embers and stories.
- **Courtship games** and ritualized competitions emerge to test the compatibility of potential nestmates.

**Biological Changes:**

- Upright posture becomes the norm, and cassowaries grow slightly taller to scan the open savanna.
- Cassowaries gain broader social recognition, strengthening bonds with distant groups.

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- Humans begin developing more advanced tool use and hunting techniques but remain isolated in Africa. Cassowaries spread across Sahul, forming early trade networks.

### **6\. The Age of Language**

**Human Time:** \~15,000 BCE  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~Year \-56,000

**Environment:**

- Northern Australia (Daintree and Arnhem regions) remains forested, while much of the interior becomes semi-arid.
- Sea levels are low, creating vast migration routes across **Sahul**.

**Technologies:**

- Symbolic markings and territorial markers to convey information.
- Simple woven barriers for protecting farms and nests.

**Cultures:**

- Vocal language develops, allowing detailed storytelling and negotiation.
- Female Connectors become respected diplomats who forge alliances between nests.

**Biological Changes:**

- Increased brain size allows for more advanced communication and problem-solving.
- Chicks remain under parental care longer, fostering more complex learning.

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- Humans in Africa develop their own early languages and begin migrating to other continents. Cassowaries remain isolated in Sahul but create vast communication networks.

### **7\. The Age of Written Language**

**Human Time:** \~10,000 BCE  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~Year \-61,000

**Environment:**

- Wetlands and rivers expand across northern Australia. The Great Barrier Reef forms as sea levels rise.

**Technologies:**

- Ravens are domesticated as messengers, using tools to carve symbols onto bark.
- Proto-writing systems emerge to track trade, agreements, and oral histories.

**Cultures:**

- Nests hold records of lineage and territorial claims.
- Law emerges as a structured system of resolution, often performed as ritualized games.

**Biological Changes:**

- Longer communication-related vocal cords enable complex calls and "song histories."

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- Humans begin farming and domesticating animals in Mesopotamia. Cassowaries develop written symbols to complement their verbal histories.

### **8\. The Age of Metallurgy**

**Human Time:** \~5,000 BCE  
 **Cassowary Time:** \~Year \-66,000

**Environment:**

- Central Australia becomes increasingly arid, but river systems support regional hubs.

**Technologies:**

- Cassowaries mine and refine iron ore to forge steel tools and ceremonial objects.
- Diprotodons are used to power treadmills and pulleys for mining and transportation.

**Cultures:**

- Trade hubs become proto-cities, with specialized labor and artisans.
- Religious and social rituals center around fire and metalwork.

**Split from the Human Timeline:**

- Humans build their first cities in Mesopotamia. Cassowaries begin constructing fortified trade outposts.

9\. The Age of Queens

Human Time: \~2,000 BCE

Cassowary Time: \~Year \-68,000

Environment:

Northern Australia’s rainforests remain rich, though they’ve receded from earlier borders.

Coastal regions flourish due to wetland expansion, but the central plains grow harsher and more isolated.

Settlements form near fertile waterways, creating hierarchies based on access to land and resources.

Technologies:

Advanced water management systems, including channels to maintain insect farms and hydrate settlements.

The development of protective fortresses made from fire-hardened timber and stone to defend key trade hubs.

Domestication of cockatoos for voice-based messages between courts, reinforcing communication networks.

Cultures:

Queenship Rises: Female leaders, often from Connector lineages, become key figures of governance, diplomacy, and ritual. Known as “Flame Bearers,” they are both political rulers and symbolic keepers of their hearths.

Ritual Fire Diplomacy: Political negotiations often involve elaborate fire-lighting ceremonies and symbolic exchanges of embers.

Courts are structured polycules, with Queens surrounded by advisors representing family units and artisans.

Biological Changes:

Casques develop larger, more pronounced crests in some populations, signifying lineage and status.

Vocalization patterns evolve into complex calls used during royal announcements and public disputes.

Split from the Human Timeline:

Human civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt consolidate under kings and emperors. Cassowaries, by contrast, evolve matriarchal dynasties where female rulers negotiate through ritualized “fire treaties” rather than direct warfare.

10\. The Age of Companies

Human Time: \~1700s CE (early industrial age)

Cassowary Time: \~Year \-69,800

Environment:

Northern Australia remains forested but dotted with industrial zones near ore-rich hills.

Coastal ports expand into city-states connected by Diprotodon-powered transport systems.

The wetlands near Werribee become trade hubs for farming and aquaculture, but overuse begins to deplete their ecosystems.

Technologies:

Widespread steel usage for agricultural tools, transport tracks, and defense systems.

Cable-pulled ships replace sails, using Diprotodon treadmills to power maritime trade routes.

Standardized accounting and proto-currency systems are tracked by raven record-keepers who document transactions on bark ledgers.

Cultures:

Corporate Clans: Massive trading companies form, rivaling governments in influence and power. They organize their territories through contracts, debt systems, and ownership stakes in insect farms and trade routes.

Debt-Based Society: Laborers can buy shares to increase their status but risk losing everything if quotas aren’t met. This leads to the rise of “partially owned citizens”—those bound by debt but still retaining partial rights.

Cultural festivals shift from communal celebrations of fire to celebrations of corporate achievements, such as new trade route openings or record harvests.

Biological Changes:

Slight cognitive adaptations in some subgroups due to the mental demands of trade negotiation and resource management. These include increased memory capacity and specialization in navigational instincts.

Split from the Human Timeline:

Humans enter the age of colonial empires and industrial capitalism. Cassowaries parallel this through corporate empires focused on controlled resource extraction rather than colonization of distant continents.
